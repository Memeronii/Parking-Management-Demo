## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenCV 4.5+
- Flask 2.0+
- Ultralytics (YOLOv8)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Memeronii/CompVisionParking.git
   cd CompVisionParking
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download YOLO model** (if not already present)
   ```bash
   # The yolov8s.pt model should be included in the repository
   # If missing, it will be automatically downloaded on first run
   ```

4. **Add your video file**
   ```bash
   # Place your parking lot video in the videos/ directory
   # Default: videos/Car_Park_Timelapse_Video_Generated.mp4
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the system**
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:5000
   ```

## üéÆ Usage Guide

### Initial Setup
1. **Load the System**: The application will start with a live video feed
2. **Draw Parking Spaces**: Use your mouse to draw rectangular boxes around parking spaces
3. **Save Configuration**: Click "Save Parking Spaces" to store your annotations
4. **Monitor Live**: Watch as the system detects vehicles and updates occupancy status

### Drawing Parking Spaces
- **Click and Drag**: Click anywhere on the video and drag to create a parking space box
- **Multiple Spaces**: Draw as many parking spaces as needed
- **Visual Feedback**: Green boxes indicate vacant spaces, red indicates occupied
- **Reset Option**: Use "Reset Spaces" to clear all annotations and start over

### Booking System Demo
1. **View Available Spaces**: Check the "Parking Reservations" panel
2. **Book a Space**: Click "Book Parking Space" to open the booking modal
3. **Select Details**: Choose space, date, time, and user type
4. **Confirm Booking**: Review pricing and confirm your reservation
5. **QR Code**: Receive a digital parking permit (demo QR code)

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend (Flask)
- **Video Processing**: OpenCV-based frame capture and processing
- **AI Detection**: YOLOv8 integration for vehicle recognition
- **Real-time Streaming**: MJPEG streaming with multipart responses
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful endpoints for space management and occupancy data

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- **Interactive Canvas**: Mouse-driven parking space annotation
- **Real-time Updates**: AJAX polling for live occupancy status
- **Material Design 3**: Modern UI with CSS custom properties
- **Responsive Layout**: 3-column grid system with adaptive sizing

### AI/ML Components
- **YOLOv8 Model**: `yolov8s.pt` for vehicle detection
- **Object Classification**: Car detection with confidence scoring
- **Spatial Analysis**: Overlap detection for occupancy determination
- **Performance Optimization**: Frame skipping for smooth video playback

## üîß Configuration

### Video Source
Edit `app.py` to change the video source:
```python
VIDEO_PATH = os.path.join('videos', 'your_video_file.mp4')
```

### YOLO Model
The system uses `yolov8s.pt` by default. You can change to other models:
```python
yolo_model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')  # Faster, less accurate
yolo_model = YOLO('yolov8m.pt')  # Balanced
yolo_model = YOLO('yolov8l.pt')  # Slower, more accurate
```

### Performance Settings
Adjust frame processing frequency in `app.py`:
```python
# Only update occupancy detection every N frames
if frame_count % 3 == 0:  # Change 3 to adjust frequency
```

## üé® UI/UX Features
